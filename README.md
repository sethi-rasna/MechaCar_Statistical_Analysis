# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

  - What metric or metrics are you going to test?
      - For this test, I would like to compare how the price of a vehicle is correlated with highway and city fuel efficient miles a vehicle gets.
      
  - What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
      - To do this, I would set my null hypothesis as: If the MechaCar is not fuel efficient on highways or in cities, the cost of the vehicle will be lower the average vehicle in it's marketshare. The alternative hypothesis would then be: if the MechaCar is fuel efficient on highways and in cities, the the cost of the vehicle will be higher than the average vehicle in it's marketshare.
      
  - What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
      - I would run a correlation/linear regression test on this comparing the prices of vehicles in the marketshare for the MechaCar, including the MechaCar, with the number of fuel efficent miles each vehicle gets. The independent variable in this case would be the vehicle price and the dependent variable would be the number of fuel efficient miles each vehicle gets. Given the assumpution made in the null and alternative hypothesis, we would hope to see a positive correlation and a upward sloping linar regression in this model.
  
  - What data is needed to run the statistical test?
       - The data needed for this would be the fuel efficient miles (both city and highway) for all the vehicles (regardless of make or model) that are in the same marketshare as the MechaCar. Additionally, this analysis would call for the prices of those vehicles too. It would be interesting to have listed the make and model of each car as well that way we could compare certains makes against one another and develop more in depth analysis.
